# Benchmark C++ Tool

This topic demonstrates how to use the Benchmark C++ Tool to estimate deep learning inference performance on supported devices. Performance can be measured for two inference modes: synchronous (latency-oriented) and asynchronous (throughput-oriented).

> **NOTE**: This topic describes usage of C++ implementation of the Benchmark Tool. For the Python* implementation, refer to [Benchmark Python* Tool](../../benchmark_tool/README.md).


## How It Works

Upon start-up, the application reads command-line parameters and loads a network and images/binary files to the Inference Engine plugin, which is chosen depending on a specified device. The number of infer requests and execution approach depend on the mode defined with the `-api` command-line parameter.

> **NOTE**: By default, Inference Engine samples, tools and demos expect input with BGR channels order. If you trained your model to work with RGB order, you need to manually rearrange the default channels order in the sample or demo application or reconvert your model using the Model Optimizer tool with `--reverse_input_channels` argument specified. For more information about the argument, refer to **When to Reverse Input Channels** section of [Converting a Model to Intermediate Representation (IR)](../../../docs/MO_DG/prepare_model/convert_model/Converting_Model.md).

If you run the application in the synchronous mode, it creates one infer request and executes the `Infer` method.
If you run the application in the asynchronous mode, it creates as many infer requests as specified in the `-nireq` command-line parameter and executes the `StartAsync` method for each of them. If `-nireq` is not set, the application will use the default value for specified device.

A number of execution steps is defined by one of the following parameters:
* Number of iterations specified with the `-niter` command-line argument
* Time duration specified with the `-t` command-line argument
* Both of them (execution will continue until both conditions are met)
* Predefined duration if `-niter` and `-t` are not specified. Predefined duration value depends on a device.

During the execution, the application collects latency for each executed infer request.

Reported latency value is calculated as a median value of all collected latencies. Reported throughput value is reported
in frames per second (FPS) and calculated as a derivative from:
* Reported latency in the Sync mode
* The total execution time in the Async mode

Throughput value also depends on batch size.

The application also collects per-layer Performance Measurement (PM) counters for each executed infer request if you
enable statistics dumping by setting the `-report_type` parameter to one of the possible values:
* `no_counters` report includes configuration options specified, resulting FPS and latency.
* `average_counters` report extends the `no_counters` report and additionally includes average PM counters values for each layer from the network.
* `detailed_counters` report extends the `average_counters` report and additionally includes per-layer PM counters and latency for each executed infer request.

Depending on the type, the report is stored to `benchmark_no_counters_report.csv`, `benchmark_average_counters_report.csv`,
or `benchmark_detailed_counters_report.csv` file located in the path specified in `-report_folder`.

The application also saves executable graph information serialized to an XML file if you specify a path to it with the
`-exec_graph_path` parameter.

## Building
This tools can be built as part of OpenVINO, during standard building process. More information about building OpenVINO can be found here[Build OpenVINO Inference Engine](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/wiki/BuildingCode)

## Run the Tool

Note that the benchmark_app usually produces optimal performance for any device out of the box.

**So in most cases you don't need to play the app options explicitly and the plain device name is enough**, for example, for CPU:
```sh
./benchmark_app -m <model> -i <input> -d CPU
```

It still may be sub-optimal for some cases, especially for very small networks. For all devices, including the [MULTI device](../../../docs/OV_Runtime_UG/supported_plugins/MULTI.md) it is preferable to use the FP16 IR for the model. If latency of the CPU inference on the multi-socket machines is of concern.
These, as well as other topics are explained in the [Performance Optimization Guide](../../../docs/optimization_guide/dldt_deployment_optimization_guide.md).

Running the application with the `-h` option yields the following usage message:

                                it still may be non-optimal for some cases, especially for very small networks.
                                Also, using nstreams>1 is inherently throughput-oriented option, while for the best-latency

```

Running the application with the empty list of options yields the usage message given above and an error message.

Application supports topologies with one or more inputs. If a topology is not data-sensitive, you can skip the input parameter. In this case, inputs are filled with random values.
If a model has only image input(s), please provide a folder with images or a path to an image as input.
If a model has some specific input(s) (not images), please prepare a binary file(s) that is filled with data of appropriate precision and provide a path to them as input.
If a model has mixed input types, input folder should contain all required files. Image inputs are filled with image files one by one. Binary inputs are filled with binary inputs one by one.

To run the tool, you can use [public](@ref omz_models_group_public) or [Intel's](@ref omz_models_group_intel) pre-trained models from the Open Model Zoo. The models can be downloaded using the [Model Downloader](@ref omz_tools_downloader).

> **NOTE**: Before running the tool with a trained model, make sure the model is converted to the Inference Engine format (\*.xml + \*.bin) using the [Model Optimizer tool](../../../docs/MO_DG/Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.md).
>
> The sample accepts models in ONNX format (.onnx) that do not require preprocessing.

## Examples of Running the Tool

This section provides step-by-step instructions on how to run the Benchmark Tool with the `googlenet-v1` public model on CPU or GPU devices. As an input, the `car.png` file from the `<INSTALL_DIR>/samples/scripts/` directory is used.

> **NOTE**: The Internet access is required to execute the following steps successfully. If you have access to the Internet through the proxy server only, please make sure that it is configured in your OS environment.

1. Download the model. Install openvino-dev package into Python virtual environment from PyPi and run omz_downloader:
   ```sh
   omz_downloader --name googlenet-v1 -o <models_dir>
2. Convert the model to the Inference Engine IR format. Run the Model Optimizer using the `mo` command with the path to the model, model format (which must be FP32 for CPU and FPG) and output directory to generate the IR files:
   ```sh
   mo --input_model <models_dir>/public/googlenet-v1/googlenet-v1.caffemodel --data_type FP32 --output_dir <ir_dir>
   ```
3. Run the tool with specifying the `<INSTALL_DIR>/samples/scripts/car.png` file as an input image, the IR of the `googlenet-v1` model and a device to perform inference on. The following commands demonstrate running the Benchmark Tool in the asynchronous mode on CPU and GPU devices:

   * On CPU:
   ```sh
   ./benchmark_app -m <ir_dir>/googlenet-v1.xml -i <INSTALL_DIR>/samples/scripts/car.png  -d CPU -api async --progress true
   ```
   * On GPU:
   ```sh
   ./benchmark_app -m <ir_dir>/googlenet-v1.xml -i <INSTALL_DIR>/samples/scripts/car.png -d GPU -api async --progress true
   ```

The application outputs the number of executed iterations, total duration of execution, latency, and throughput.
Additionally, if you set the `-report_type` parameter, the application outputs statistics report. If you set the `-pc` parameter, the application outputs performance counters. If you set `-exec_graph_path`, the application reports executable graph information serialized. All measurements including per-layer PM counters are reported in milliseconds.

Below are fragments of sample output:

   ```
