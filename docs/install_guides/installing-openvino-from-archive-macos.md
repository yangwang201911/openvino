# Install OpenVINO™ Runtime on macOS from an Archive File {#openvino_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_from_archive_macos}

With the OpenVINO™ 2022.2 release, you can download and use archive files to install OpenVINO Runtime. The archive files contain pre-built binaries and library files needed for OpenVINO Runtime, as well as code samples.

Installing OpenVINO Runtime from archive files is recommended for C++ developers. If you are working with Python, the PyPI package has everything needed for Python development and deployment on CPU and GPUs. Visit the [Install OpenVINO from PyPI](installing-openvino-pip.md) page for instructions on how to install OpenVINO Runtime for Python using PyPI.

See the [Release Notes](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/OpenVINO-RelNotes) for more information on updates in the latest release.

> **NOTE**: Since the OpenVINO™ 2022.1 release, the following development tools: Model Optimizer, Post-Training Optimization Tool, Model Downloader and other Open Model Zoo tools, Accuracy Checker, and Annotation Converter can be installed via [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/openvino-dev/) only.

> **NOTE**: The Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit is supported on macOS version 10.15 with Intel® processor-based machines.

## System Requirements

@sphinxdirective

.. tab:: Operating Systems

  macOS 10.15, 11, 12, and 13 versions with the x86 architecture, 64 bits
  
  .. note::
   
     Only macOS 10.15 is fully validated with OpenVINO. Other versions depend on the compatibility of macOS.

.. tab:: Hardware

  Optimized for these processors:

  * 6th to 12th generation Intel® Core™ processors and Intel® Xeon® processors 
  * 3rd generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processor (formerly code named Cooper Lake)
  * Intel® Xeon® Scalable processor (formerly Skylake and Cascade Lake)
  * Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2
  
  .. note::
    The current version of the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit for macOS supports inference on Intel CPUs and Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2 devices only.

.. tab:: Software Requirements

  * `CMake 3.13 or higher <https://cmake.org/download/>`_ (choose "macOS 10.13 or later"). Add `/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin` to path (for default install). 
  * `Python 3.7 - 3.10 <https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/>`_ (choose 3.7 - 3.10). Install and add to path.
  * Apple Xcode Command Line Tools. In the terminal, run `xcode-select --install` from any directory
  * (Optional) Apple Xcode IDE (not required for OpenVINO™, but useful for development)

## Installing OpenVINO Runtime

### <a name="install-core"></a>Step 1: Install OpenVINO Core Components

1. Open a command prompt terminal window. 
2. Create the `/opt/intel` folder for OpenVINO by using the following command. If the folder already exists, skip this command.
   ```sh
   sudo mkdir /opt/intel
   ```
   > **NOTE**: The `/opt/intel` path is the recommended folder path for installing OpenVINO. You may use a different path if desired.

3. Browse to the current user's `Downloads` folder:
   ```sh
    cd <user_home>/Downloads
    ```
    
4. Download the [OpenVINO Runtime archive file for macOS](https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/repositories/openvino/packages/2022.2/macos/), extract the files, rename the extracted folder and move it to the desired path:
   ```sh
   curl -L https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/repositories/openvino/packages/2022.2/macos/m_openvino_toolkit_osx_2022.2.0.7713.af16ea1d79a_x86_64.tgz --output openvino_2022.2.0.7713.tgz
   tar -xf openvino_2022.2.0.7713.tgz
   sudo mv m_openvino_toolkit_osx_2022.2.0.7713.af16ea1d79a_x86_64 /opt/intel/openvino_2022.2.0.7713
   ```

5. For simplicity, it is useful to create a symbolic link as below:
   ```
   sudo ln -s openvino_2022.2.0.7713 openvino_2022
   ```
   > **NOTE**: If you have already installed a previous release of OpenVINO 2022, a symbolic link to the `openvino_2022` folder may already exist. Unlink the previous link with `sudo unlink openvino_2022`, and then re-run the command above.


Congratulations, you finished the installation! The `/opt/intel/openvino_2022` folder now contains the core components for OpenVINO. If you used a different path in Step 2, you will find the `openvino_2022` folder there. The path to the `openvino_2022` directory is also referred as `<INSTALL_DIR>` throughout the OpenVINO documentation.

### <a name="set-the-environment-variables"></a>Step 2: Configure the Environment

You must update several environment variables before you can compile and run OpenVINO applications. Open a terminal window and run the `setupvars.sh` script as shown below to temporarily set your environment variables. If your <INSTALL_DIR> is not `/opt/intel/openvino_2022`, use the correct one instead.

```sh
source /opt/intel/openvino_2022/setupvars.sh
```  

If you have more than one OpenVINO™ version on your machine, you can easily switch its version by sourcing the `setupvars.sh` of your choice.

> **NOTE**: The above command must be re-run every time you start a new terminal session. To set up macOS to automatically run the command every time a new terminal is opened, open `~/.zshrc` in your favorite editor and add `source /opt/intel/openvino_2022/setupvars.sh` after the last line. Next time when you open a terminal, you will see `[setupvars.sh] OpenVINO™ environment initialized`. Changing `~/.zshrc` is not recommended when you have multiple OpenVINO versions on your machine and want to switch among them.

The environment variables are set. Continue to the next section if you want to download any additional components.

### <a name="model-optimizer"></a>Step 3 (Optional): Install Additional Components

OpenVINO Development Tools is a set of utilities for working with OpenVINO and OpenVINO models. It provides tools like Model Optimizer, Benchmark Tool, Post-Training Optimization Tool, and Open Model Zoo Downloader. If you install OpenVINO Runtime using archive files, OpenVINO Development Tools must be installed separately.

See the [Install OpenVINO Development Tools](installing-model-dev-tools.md) page for step-by-step installation instructions.

OpenCV is necessary to run demos from Open Model Zoo (OMZ). Some OpenVINO samples can also extend their capabilities when compiled with OpenCV as a dependency. To install OpenCV for OpenVINO, see the [instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/BuildOpenCV4OpenVINO).

### <a name="configure-ncs2"></a>Step 4 (Optional): Configure the Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2 

@sphinxdirective

If you want to run inference on Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2 use the following instructions to setup the device: :ref:`NCS2 Setup Guide <ncs guide macos>`.
