OpenVINO™ Runtime
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Common
-----------------------------

* The legacy API for CPP and Python bindings has been removed.
* StringTensor support has been extended by operators such as ``Gather``, ``Reshape``, and
  ``Concat``, as a foundation to improve support for tokenizer operators and compliance with
  the TensorFlow Hub.
* oneDNN has been updated to v3.3.
  (`see oneDNN release notes <https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN/releases>`__).


CPU Device Plugin
-----------------------------

* LLM performance on Intel® CPU platforms has been improved for systems based on AVX2 and
  AVX512, using dynamic quantization and internal memory state optimization, such as INT8
  precision for KV-cache. 13th and 14th generations of Intel® Core™ processors and Intel® Core™
  Ultra processors use AVX2 for CPU execution, and these platforms will benefit from speedup.
  Enable these features by setting ``"DYNAMIC_QUANTIZATION_GROUP_SIZE":"32"`` and
  ``"KV_CACHE_PRECISION":"u8"`` in the configuration file.
* The ``ov::affinity`` API configuration is now deprecated and will be removed in release
  2025.0.
* The following have been improved and optimized:

  * Multi-query structure LLMs (such as ChatGLM 2/3) for BF16 on the 4th and 5th generation
    Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors.
  * `Mixtral <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/mixtral>`__ model performance.
  * 8-bit compressed LLM compilation time and memory usage, valuable for models with large
    embeddings like `Qwen <https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen>`__.
  * Convolutional networks in FP16 precision on ARM platforms.

GPU Device Plugin
-----------------------------

* The following have been improved and optimized:

  * Average token latency for LLMs on integrated GPU (iGPU) platforms, using INT4-compressed
    models with large context size on Intel® Core™ Ultra processors.
  * LLM beam search performance on iGPU. Both average and first-token latency decrease may be
    expected for larger context sizes.
  * Multi-batch performance of YOLOv5 on iGPU platforms.

* Memory usage for LLMs has been optimized, enabling '7B' models with larger context on
  16Gb platforms.

NPU Device Plugin (preview feature)
-----------------------------------

* The NPU plugin for OpenVINO™ is now available through PyPI (run “pip install openvino”).

OpenVINO Python API
-----------------------------

* ``.add_extension`` method signatures have been aligned, improving API behavior for better
  user experience.

OpenVINO C API
-----------------------------

* ov_property_key_cache_mode (C++ ov::cache_mode) now enables the ``optimize_size`` and
  ``optimize_speed`` modes to set/get model cache.
* The VA surface on Windows exception has been fixed.

OpenVINO Node.js API
-----------------------------

* OpenVINO - `JS bindings <https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/api/nodejs_api/nodejs_api.html>`__
  are consistent with the OpenVINO C++ API.
* A new distribution channel is now available: Node Package Manager (npm) software registry
  (:doc:`check the installation guide <../get-started/install-openvino/install-openvino-npm>`).
* JavaScript API is now available for Windows users, as some limitations for platforms other
  than Linux have been removed.

-----------------------------

* String tensors are now natively supported, handled on input, output, and intermediate layers
  (`PR #22024 <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/pull/22024>`__).

  * TensorFlow Hub universal-sentence-encoder-multilingual inferred out of the box
  * string tensors supported for ``Gather``, ``Concat``, and ``Reshape`` operations
  * integration with openvino-tokenizers module - importing openvino-tokenizers automatically
    patches TensorFlow FE with the required translators for models with tokenization

* Fallback for Model Optimizer by operation to the legacy Frontend is no longer available.
  Fallback by .json config will remain until Model Optimizer is discontinued
  (`PR #21523 <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/pull/21523>`__).
* Support for the following has been added:

  * Mutable variables and resources such as HashTable*, Variable, VariableV2
    (`PR #22270 <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/pull/22270>`__).
  * New tensor types: tf.u16, tf.u32, and tf.u64

Known issues
-----------------------------

| **Component - CPU Plugin**
| *ID* - N/A
| *Description:*
|   Starting with 24.0, model inputs and outputs will no longer have tensor names, unless
    explicitly set to align with the PyTorch framework behavior.

| **Component - GPU runtime**
| *ID* - 132376
| *Description:*
|   First-inference latency slow down for LLMs on Intel® Core™ Ultra processors. Up to 10-20%
    drop may occur due to radical memory optimization for processing long sequences
    (about 1.5-2 GB reduced memory usage).

| **Component - CPU runtime**
| *ID* - N/A
| *Description:*
|   Performance results (first token latency) may vary from those offered by the previous OpenVINO version, for
    “latency” hint inference of LLMs with long prompts on Xeon platforms with 2 or more
    sockets. The reason is that all CPU cores of just the single socket running the application
    are employed, lowering the memory overhead for LLMs when numa control is not used.
| *Workaround:*
|   The behavior is expected but stream and thread configuration may be used to include cores
    from all sockets.


Deprecation And Support
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Using deprecated features and components is not advised. They are available to enable a smooth
transition to new solutions and will be discontinued in the future. To keep using discontinued
features, you will have to revert to the last LTS OpenVINO version supporting them.
For more details, refer to the :doc:`OpenVINO Legacy Features and Components <../documentation/legacy-features>`
page.

Discontinued in 2024
-----------------------------

* Runtime components:

  * Intel® Gaussian & Neural Accelerator (Intel® GNA). Consider using the Neural Processing
    Unit (NPU) for low-powered systems like Intel® Core™ Ultra or 14th generation and beyond.
  * OpenVINO C++/C/Python 1.0 APIs (see
    `2023.3 API transition guide <https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.3/openvino_2_0_transition_guide.html>`__
    for reference).
  * All ONNX Frontend legacy API (known as ONNX_IMPORTER_API)
  * ``PerfomanceMode.UNDEFINED`` property as part of the OpenVINO Python API

    (POT). Neural Network Compression Framework (NNCF) should be used instead.
  * A `Git patch <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/tree/develop/third_party_integration/huggingface_transformers>`__
    for NNCF integration with `huggingface/transformers <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers>`__.
    The recommended approach is to use `huggingface/optimum-intel <https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel>`__
    for applying NNCF optimization on top of models from Hugging Face.
  * Support for Apache MXNet, Caffe, and Kaldi model formats. Conversion to ONNX may be used
    as a solution.

Deprecated and to be removed in the future
--------------------------------------------

* The OpenVINO™ Development Tools package (pip install openvino-dev) will be removed from
  installation options and distribution channels beginning with OpenVINO 2025.
* Model Optimizer will be discontinued with OpenVINO 2025.0. Consider using the
  :doc:`new conversion methods <../openvino-workflow/model-preparation/convert-model-to-ir>`
  instead. For more details, see the
  :doc:`model conversion transition guide <../documentation/legacy-features/transition-legacy-conversion-api>`.
