.. danger:: Post-training Optimization Tool is deprecated since OpenVINO 2023.0. :doc:`Neural Network Compression Framework (NNCF) <ptq_introduction>` is recommended for the post-training quantization instead.

This section provides a set of examples that demonstrate how to apply the post-training optimization methods to optimize various models from different domains. It contains optimization recipes for concrete models, that unnecessarily cover your case, but which should be sufficient to reuse these recipes to optimize custom models:
