# CPU Device {#openvino_docs_OV_UG_supported_plugins_CPU}

The CPU plugin is a part of the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit. It is developed to achieve high performance inference of neural networks on Intel® x86-64 CPUs.
For an in-depth description of CPU plugin, see:

- [CPU plugin developers documentation](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/wiki/CPUPluginDevelopersDocs).

- [OpenVINO Runtime CPU plugin source files](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/tree/master/src/plugins/intel_cpu/).



## Device Name
The `CPU` device name is used for the CPU plugin. Even though there can be more than one physical socket on a platform, only one device of this kind is listed by OpenVINO.
On multi-socket platforms, load balancing and memory usage distribution between NUMA nodes are handled automatically.   
In order to use CPU for inference, the device name should be passed to the `ov::Core::compile_model()` method:

## Supported Inference Data Types
CPU plugin supports the following data types as inference precision of internal primitives:

- Floating-point data types:
  - f32
  - bf16
- Integer data types:
  - i32
- Quantized data types:
  - u8
  - i8
  - u1
  
[Hello Query Device C++ Sample](../../../samples/cpp/hello_query_device/README.md) can be used to print out supported data types for all detected devices.

### Quantized Data Types Specifics

Selected precision of each primitive depends on the operation precision in IR, quantization primitives, and available hardware capabilities.
The `u1/u8/i8` data types are used for quantized operations only, i.e., those are not selected automatically for non-quantized operations.

See the [low-precision optimization guide](@ref openvino_docs_model_optimization_guide) for more details on how to get a quantized model.

> **NOTE**: Platforms that do not support Intel® AVX512-VNNI have a known "saturation issue" that may lead to reduced computational accuracy for `u8/i8` precision calculations.
> See the [saturation (overflow) issue section](@ref pot_saturation_issue) to get more information on how to detect such issues and possible workarounds.

### Floating Point Data Types Specifics

The default floating-point precision of a CPU primitive is `f32`. To support the `f16` OpenVINO IR the plugin internally converts all the `f16` values to `f32` and all the calculations are performed using the native precision of `f32`.
On platforms that natively support `bfloat16` calculations (have the `AVX512_BF16` extension), the `bf16` type is automatically used instead of `f32` to achieve better performance. Thus, no special steps are required to run a `bf16` model.
For more details about the `bfloat16` format, see the [BFLOAT16 – Hardware Numerics Definition white paper](https://software.intel.com/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/documents/bf16-hardware-numerics-definition-white-paper.pdf).

Using the `bf16` precision provides the following performance benefits:

- Faster multiplication of two `bfloat16` numbers because of shorter mantissa of the `bfloat16` data.
- Reduced memory consumption since `bfloat16` data half the size of 32-bit float. 

To check if the CPU device can support the `bfloat16` data type, use the [query device properties interface](./config_properties.md) to query `ov::device::capabilities` property, which should contain `BF16` in the list of CPU capabilities:

@endsphinxtab

@sphinxtab{Python}
@snippet docs/snippets/cpu/Bfloat16Inference.py part0
@endsphinxtab

@endsphinxtabset

If the model has been converted to `bf16`, the `ov::hint::inference_precision` is set to `ov::element::bf16` and can be checked via the `ov::CompiledModel::get_property` call. The code below demonstrates how to get the element type:

@snippet snippets/cpu/Bfloat16Inference1.cpp part1

To infer the model in `f32` precision instead of `bf16` on targets with native `bf16` support, set the `ov::hint::inference_precision` to `ov::element::f32`.

@sphinxtabset

@endsphinxtab

@sphinxtab{Python}
@snippet docs/snippets/cpu/Bfloat16Inference.py part2
@endsphinxtab

@endsphinxtabset

The `Bfloat16` software simulation mode is available on CPUs with Intel® AVX-512 instruction set that do not support the native `avx512_bf16` instruction. This mode is used for development purposes and it does not guarantee good performance.
To enable the simulation, the `ov::hint::inference_precision` has to be explicitly set to `ov::element::bf16`.

> **NOTE**: If ov::hint::inference_precision is set to ov::element::bf16 on a CPU without native bfloat16 support or bfloat16 simulation mode, an exception is thrown.

> **NOTE**: Due to the reduced mantissa size of the `bfloat16` data type, the resulting `bf16` inference accuracy may differ from the `f32` inference, especially for models that were not trained using the `bfloat16` data type. If the `bf16` inference accuracy is not acceptable, it is recommended to switch to the `f32` precision.
  
## Supported Features

### Multi-device Execution
If a system includes OpenVINO-supported devices other than the CPU (e.g. an integrated GPU), then any supported model can be executed on all the devices simultaneously.
This can be achieved by specifying `MULTI:CPU,GPU.0` as a target device in case of simultaneous usage of CPU and GPU.

For more details, see the [Multi-device execution](../multi_device.md) article.

### Multi-stream Execution
If either `ov::num_streams(n_streams)` with `n_streams > 1` or `ov::hint::performance_mode(ov::hint::PerformanceMode::THROUGHPUT)` property is set for CPU plugin,
then multiple streams are created for the model. In case of CPU plugin, each stream has its own host thread, which means that incoming infer requests can be processed simultaneously.
Each stream is pinned to its own group of physical cores with respect to NUMA nodes physical memory usage to minimize overhead on data transfer between NUMA nodes.

For more details, see the [optimization guide](@ref openvino_docs_deployment_optimization_guide_dldt_optimization_guide).

> **NOTE**: When it comes to latency, be aware that running only one stream on multi-socket platform may introduce additional overheads on data transfer between NUMA nodes.
> In that case it is better to use the `ov::hint::PerformanceMode::LATENCY` performance hint. For more details see the [performance hints](@ref openvino_docs_OV_UG_Performance_Hints) overview.

### Dynamic Shapes
CPU provides full functional support for models with dynamic shapes in terms of the opset coverage.

> **NOTE**: The CPU plugin does not support tensors with dynamically changing rank. In case of an attempt to infer a model with such tensors, an exception will be thrown.

Dynamic shapes support introduces additional overhead on memory management and may limit internal runtime optimizations.
The more degrees of freedom are used, the more difficult it is to achieve the best performance.
The most flexible configuration, and the most convenient approach, is the fully undefined shape, which means that no constraints to the shape dimensions are applied.
However, reducing the level of uncertainty results in performance gains.
You can reduce memory consumption through memory reuse, achieving better cache locality and increasing inference performance. To do so, set dynamic shapes explicitly, with defined upper bounds.

> **NOTE**: Using fully undefined shapes may result in significantly higher memory consumption compared to inferring the same model with static shapes.
> If memory consumption is unacceptable but dynamic shapes are still required, the model can be reshaped using shapes with defined upper bounds to reduce memory footprint.

Some runtime optimizations work better if the model shapes are known in advance.
Therefore, if the input data shape is not changed between inference calls, it is recommended to use a model with static shapes or reshape the existing model with the static input shape to get the best performance.

### Preprocessing Acceleration
CPU plugin supports a full set of the preprocessing operations, providing high performance implementations for them.

For more details, see [preprocessing API guide](../preprocessing_overview.md).

@sphinxdirective

    * i16
    * i32
    * i64
    * u8
    * u16
    * u32
    * u64
    * boolean
@endsphinxdirective

### Models Caching
CPU supports Import/Export network capability. If model caching is enabled via the common OpenVINO™ `ov::cache_dir` property, the plugin automatically creates a cached blob inside the specified directory during model compilation.
This cached blob contains partial representation of the network, having performed common runtime optimizations and low precision transformations.
The next time the model is compiled, the cached representation will be loaded to the plugin instead of the initial OpenVINO IR, so the aforementioned transformation steps will be skipped.
These transformations take a significant amount of time during model compilation, so caching this representation reduces time spent for subsequent compilations of the model,
thereby reducing first inference latency (FIL).

For more details, see the [model caching](@ref openvino_docs_OV_UG_Model_caching_overview) overview.

### Extensibility
CPU plugin supports fallback on `ov::Op` reference implementation if the plugin do not have its own implementation for such operation.
That means that [OpenVINO™ Extensibility Mechanism](@ref openvino_docs_Extensibility_UG_Intro) can be used for the plugin extension as well.
Enabling fallback on a custom operation implementation is possible by overriding the `ov::Op::evaluate` method in the derived operation class (see [custom OpenVINO™ operations](@ref openvino_docs_Extensibility_UG_add_openvino_ops) for details).

> **NOTE**: At the moment, custom operations with internal dynamism (when the output tensor shape can only be determined as a result of performing the operation) are not supported by the plugin.

### Stateful Models
The CPU plugin supports stateful models without any limitations.

For details, see [stateful models guide](@ref openvino_docs_OV_UG_network_state_intro).

## Optimization guide

### Denormals Optimization
Denormal numbers (denormals) are non-zero, finite float numbers that are very close to zero, i.e. the numbers in (0, 1.17549e-38) and (0, -1.17549e-38). In such cases, normalized-number encoding format does not have a capability to encode the number and underflow will happen. The computation involving such numbers is extremely slow on much hardware.

As a denormal number is extremely close to zero, treating a denormal directly as zero is a straightforward and simple method to optimize computation of denormals. This optimization does not comply with IEEE 754 standard. If it causes unacceptable accuracy degradation, the `denormals_optimization` property is introduced to control this behavior. If there are denormal numbers in use cases, and no or acceptable accuracy drop is seen, set the property to `True` to improve performance, otherwise set it to `False`. If it is not set explicitly by the property and the application does not perform any denormals optimization as well, the optimization is disabled by default. After enabling the `denormals_optimization` property, OpenVINO will provide a cross operation system/ compiler and safe optimization on all platform when applicable.

There are cases when the application in which OpenVINO is used also performs this low-level denormals optimization. If it is optimized by setting the FTZ(Flush-To-Zero) and DAZ(Denormals-As-Zero) flags in MXCSR register at the beginning of the thread where OpenVINO is called, OpenVINO will inherit this setting in the same thread and sub-thread, so there is no need to set the `denormals_optimization` property. In such cases, you are responsible for the effectiveness and safety of the settings.

> **NOTE**: The `denormals_optimization` property must be set before calling `compile_model()`.

To enable denormals optimization in the application, the `denormals_optimization` property must be set to `True`:
